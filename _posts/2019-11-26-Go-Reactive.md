If you want to know more about what is the link between this paradigm and the other paradigms (imperative, declarative, functional), should you adopt one or a combination of these paradigms in your next project or refactoring? Then head over to [Arolla blog](https://www.arolla.fr/blog/2019/11/passer-a-vitesse-superieure-grace-a-programmation-reactive/) to read more about it.
