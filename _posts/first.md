# Build & share independent components

Follow the[ F.I.R.S.T principle](https://addyosmani.com/first/) to build your components to be: focused, independent, reusable, small & testable.

> “[..] the *secret* to efficiently building ‘large’ things is generally to avoid building them in the first place. Instead, compose your large thing out of **smaller**, more **focused** pieces. This makes it easier to see how the small thing fits within the broader scope of your large thing.”-[Addy Osmani](https://addyosmani.com/first/)

You can also use tools like [Bit](https://bit.dev/) ([Github](https://github.com/teambit/bit)) to **source-control** each of your project’s components **independently** and **share** it to Bit’s component hub.

Shared components are displayed on Bit’s component hub with auto-generated docs and live examples.

They can be installed using NPM or “cloned” and modified, using [Bit](https://bit.dev/).

This makes it easier to find, use, and maintain components (and, therefore, easier to maintain the project).
