DDD fundamentals can be divided into two groups: building blocks and strategic design. These can be further categorized into various groups, shown as follows:

- Building blocks:
  - Ubiquitous language: A common language around the domain model and used by all team members
  - Multilayered architecture: Multilayered architecture is a common solution for DDD. It contains four layers
  - Artifacts: There are seven different artifacts used in DDD to express, create, and retrieve domain models as entities, value objects, services, aggregates, repositories, factories, modules
- Strategic design:
  - Bounded context: A description of a boundary in which a model is defined and applicable
  - Continuous integration: advocated for years as a mindset for speeding up the integration of code changes with a “little & often” approach
  - Context map: It shows how many bounded contexts are present in the enterprise model, and how they are interrelated

We will look at each parts in the next articles.
