title: Java and Future

Java has invested in a lot of various technologies and tools. With the six-month release cycles, Java is evolving quickly and passed from version 11 to 16 in less than three years, allowing it to catch up with NodeJS, Python, and even against other JVM languages (like Kotlin or Scala). As a result of this, it has added to its market stability. Nonetheless, continuous evolution is underway. Therefore, the future Java roadmap looks well-populated.

The Java LTS or (Long Term Support) version comes with some key new features within it. The two most recent Java LTS versions are Java 8 and Java 11. The next planned LTS version, JDK 17, has a release planned for September 2021. Here is the schedule for versions of Java 11 to 17:

- Java 11 (LTS):	September 2018
- Java 12: Mach 2019
- Java 13: September 2019
- Java 14: Mach 2020
- Java 15: September 2020
- Java 16: Mach 2021
- Java 17 (LTS): September 2021

While Spring Boot and Spring Cloud are the defacto way for developing Microservices, more advanced frameworks are also gaining momentum and will be more relevant in Java's future. We talk about Eclipse Microprofile, Micronaut, and Quarkus.

Some top software vendors created Microprofile for Enterprise Java. It is made to optimize Enterprise Java for Microservice Architecture. Many frameworks and libraries implement the Microprofile, and some of its features include native executables, reduced startup time, fast throughput, and minimal memory footprint. The musts for each modern, cloud-based applications.

Are you aiming for a Java future? These versions, releases, and cited frameworks and libraries are the right place to start!

I have kept this post simple, but there other subjects to see like JVM internals, Profiling, Modules, Cloud Native Java, Containers, and much more for advanced things.
